# Pulmo RAGbot - TODO List

## âœ… COMPLETED
- Fixed critical bug: `finalTopK` and `finalThreshold` variables were undefined when Qdrant not configured
  - Moved variable declarations outside Qdrant configuration block
  - Variables now available throughout the entire function scope
  - Fixes ReferenceError that was causing 500 errors in chat API
- **FIXED SIMILARITY THRESHOLD ISSUE**: Updated default threshold from 0.80 to 0.1/0.05
  - Frontend: Changed default similarity threshold from 0.80 to 0.05 (even better than 0.1)
  - Backend: Updated fallback threshold from 0.80 to 0.1
  - This fixes the issue where sources were being filtered out due to high threshold
  - Now sources with scores 0.122-0.145 will be included in RAG responses
  - System will provide rich context instead of falling back to general knowledge

## ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
- Monitor chat API performance after the threshold fix
- Test RAG functionality with the new optimal threshold

## ðŸ“‹ PENDING
- ~~Review and optimize similarity threshold settings (currently 0.80 default)~~ âœ… COMPLETED
- Consider implementing auto-tuning for similarity thresholds
- Add more comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Performance optimization for large document collections
- Add unit tests for the chat API route

## ðŸŽ¯ GOALS
- Ensure stable chat functionality regardless of Qdrant configuration
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing implementations
- Improve error messages and debugging information
- Optimize RAG performance and accuracy
