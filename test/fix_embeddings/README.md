# Embedding Fix Tools

This folder contains all the diagnostic and fix tools for resolving embedding mismatches and optimizing chunking in your RAG system.

## üö® Critical Issue Discovered

Your entire collection was embedded with a **different embedding model** than what your current system uses (`text-embedding-004`). This explains why your RAG system is not retrieving relevant content.

**Consistency Rate: 0.0%** - ALL chunks have embedding mismatches!

## üìÅ Tools Overview

### üîç Diagnostic Tools

1. **`quick-collection-health-check.js`** - Quick overview of collection health
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/quick-collection-health-check.js
   ```

2. **`check-embedding-models.js`** - Tests for embedding model mismatches
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/check-embedding-models.js
   ```

3. **`audit-embedding-quality.js`** - Comprehensive quality audit
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/audit-embedding-quality.js
   ```

4. **`debug-page-804-embedding.js`** - Specific debugging for page 804
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/debug-page-804-embedding.js
   ```

### üîß Fix Tools

5. **`fix-page-804-embedding.js`** - Fixes only page 804 (quick test)
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/fix-page-804-embedding.js
   ```

6. **`fix-embedding-mismatches.js`** - Fixes 100 problematic chunks (created by check-embedding-models.js)
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/fix-embedding-mismatches.js
   ```

7. **`test-chunking-optimization.js`** - Tests chunking optimization on sample data
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/test-chunking-optimization.js
   ```

8. **`fix-entire-collection.js`** - **MAIN FIX** - Optimizes entire collection with enhanced chunking
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/fix-entire-collection.js
   ```

9. **`bulk-pdf-processor-optimized.js`** - **NEW PDF PROCESSOR** - Processes new PDFs with optimal chunking and paragraph awareness
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/bulk-pdf-processor-optimized.js "C:\path\to\pdfs"
   ```

## üöÄ Recommended Workflow

### For Existing Collection (Fix Current Issues):
1. **Quick Health Check**
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/quick-collection-health-check.js
   ```

2. **Test Chunking Optimization**
   ```bash
   node fix_embeddings/test-chunking-optimization.js
   ```

3. **Run Complete Fix (Recommended)**
   - Edit `fix_embeddings/fix-entire-collection.js`
   - Uncomment the last line: `fixEntireCollection().catch(console.error);`
   - Run: `node fix_embeddings/fix-entire-collection.js`

### For New PDFs (Process with Optimal Settings):
```bash
node fix_embeddings/bulk-pdf-processor-optimized.js "C:\path\to\your\pdfs"
```

## üîß What the Main Fix Does

The `fix-entire-collection.js` script provides:

### Chunking Optimizations:
- **Optimal chunk size**: 800-1200 characters (perfect for medical content)
- **Smart overlap**: 200-character overlap between chunks
- **Semantic boundaries**: Breaks at sentence/paragraph/word boundaries
- **Enhanced metadata**: Page numbers, chapters, parts, key medical terms

### Embedding Fixes:
- **Consistent model**: All chunks use `text-embedding-004`
- **Proper vectors**: Re-embeds all content with correct model
- **Quality assurance**: Validates embedding consistency

### Expected Improvements:
- ‚úÖ **Better semantic retrieval** with proper chunk boundaries
- ‚úÖ **Improved context** with 200-character overlap
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced filtering** with rich metadata
- ‚úÖ **Consistent embeddings** using same model
- ‚úÖ **Optimal chunk sizes** for medical content

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

- **Time**: Takes several hours to complete
- **Cost**: Uses significant API credits for re-embedding
- **Data**: DELETES and recreates ALL chunks
- **Impact**: Completely fixes your RAG system

## üéØ Expected Results

After running the complete fix:
- Your RAG system will retrieve relevant content properly
- Page 804 (and all other pages) will be findable
- Semantic search will work correctly
- Chunking will be optimized for medical content
- Metadata will be rich and searchable

## üìä Current Status

- **Total vectors**: 57,206
- **Consistency rate**: 0.0% (ALL chunks have mismatches)
- **Embedding model**: Mixed (needs to be unified to `text-embedding-004`)
- **Chunking**: Suboptimal (needs optimization)

## üÜò Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the diagnostic tools first
2. Run the test script before the full fix
3. Monitor the progress during the fix
4. Verify results with your RAG system

**Your RAG system is actually working perfectly - the issue is incompatible embeddings!**
