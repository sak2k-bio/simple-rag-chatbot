# Simple Threshold Guide - No More Confusion! 🎯

## What's Happening (In Simple Terms)

Think of the threshold like a **filter** that decides which documents to include in your answer:

- **Low threshold (0.1)**: Includes almost all documents (more context, less precise)
- **High threshold (0.2+)**: Only includes very relevant documents (less context, more precise)

## The Problem You're Having

Your current threshold is **0.15**, but your documents have scores like:
- 0.140, 0.131, 0.130, 0.124

Since 0.140 < 0.15, **ALL documents are being filtered out**! That's why you get "The provided text does not contain any information about pneumothorax."

## Quick Fix (3 Options)

### Option 1: 🚀 One-Click Fix
Click the **"🚀 Quick Fix: Set to 0.1 (Include All Sources)"** button
- This sets threshold to 0.1
- Should include all your sources
- Try your query again

### Option 2: 🔍 Smart Analysis
1. Type your query in the input field
2. Click **"🔍 Analyze & Auto-Adjust Threshold"**
3. The system automatically sets the best threshold
4. Try your query again

### Option 3: Manual Adjustment
1. Move the slider to **0.1** (the leftmost position)
2. Try your query again

## Why This Happens

Your medical documents have **lower similarity scores** than expected. This is normal for:
- Technical medical content
- Complex terminology
- Large document collections

## What to Expect After Fixing

- ✅ Sources will be included in your answers
- ✅ You'll get proper medical information
- ✅ The AI will cite the relevant documents
- ✅ No more "no information found" responses

## Pro Tips

1. **Start with 0.1** - it's better to have too much context than none
2. **Use the analysis tool** - it automatically finds the best threshold
3. **Don't worry about the numbers** - focus on whether you get good answers
4. **If answers are too long**, gradually increase the threshold

## Still Confused?

Just click the **"🚀 Quick Fix"** button and try your query again. That's it!

**Remember**: The goal is to get good medical answers with sources, not to understand the technical details of similarity scores.
